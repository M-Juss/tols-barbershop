        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          TOL Barbershop, located at 2nd Floor, Osrem Building, Gen. Trias Drive,
          Tejero, General Trias City, Cavite, Philippines, is responsible for the
          personal information covered by this policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Public bookings:</strong> name, verified email address, phone number, barber, service, date, time, notes, group-member names, price, status, and booking reference.</li>
          <li><strong>Email records:</strong> one-time verification data and delivery status for booking updates. Verification codes are stored as secure hashes and expire.</li>
          <li><strong>Appointments:</strong> confirmation, rejection, rescheduling, cancellation, completion, no-show, and related reasons or timestamps.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> rating, optional comment, booking relationship, and whether staff feature the review publicly.</li>
          <li><strong>Walk-ins and staff accounts:</strong> operational customer details entered by staff and the identity, contact, role, session, and security data required for authorized staff access.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> security cookies, request metadata, rate-limit records, and application logs.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
        <p>
          We use this information to verify booking email addresses, review and
          manage appointments, send status updates, maintain an email-based CRM,
          request one rating after a completed booking, operate staff functions,
          prepare business reports, prevent misuse, and meet legal obligations.
          Customers do not need or receive website accounts.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Sharing and service providers</h2>
        <p>
          Authorized staff may access information needed for their work. Hosting,
          email delivery, image hosting, and other infrastructure providers may
          process limited information to provide those services. We do not sell
          personal information. We may disclose information when legally required.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Cookies and security</h2>
        <p>
          Staff areas use required session and security cookies. The public booking
          form may keep short-lived cooldown information in browser storage. We use
          input validation, sanitization, rate limits, hashed verification codes,
          role-restricted staff access, and security headers. No system can guarantee
          absolute security.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain booking, CRM, feedback, email-delivery, accounting, and security
          records as reasonably needed for shop operations, disputes, reporting, and
          legal obligations. Expired verification records and unnecessary technical
          data may be deleted or anonymized under our retention practices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Under the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012, you may have rights to be
          informed, access or correct data, object, request erasure or restriction,
          withdraw consent, and complain to the National Privacy Commission. We may
          verify your identity and retain data when a lawful basis requires it.
