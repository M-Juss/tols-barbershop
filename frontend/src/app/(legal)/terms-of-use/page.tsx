      <section>
        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          By submitting a booking or feedback, you agree to these terms and our
          Privacy Policy. Customers do not need a website account. Staff access is
          restricted to authorized administrative users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Booking requests and email verification</h2>
        <p>
          You must provide accurate information and verify the submitted email with
          the one-time code we send. Verification proves access to the email inbox;
          it does not confirm the appointment. The requested slot is checked again
          after verification and is not reserved while you enter the code.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Pending and confirmed bookings</h2>
        <p>
          Every submitted request starts as <strong>pending</strong>. It becomes a
          confirmed appointment only after authorized staff confirm it. Staff may
          reject or reschedule a request due to availability, closures, conflicts,
          safety, or other reasonable operational needs. Updates are sent to the
          verified booking email, so you are responsible for checking that inbox.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Group bookings</h2>
        <p>
          A group booker confirms that they may provide each participant&apos;s name
          and booking details and receive communications for the group. One rating
          may be submitted for the completed group booking.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Prices, cancellations, and no-shows</h2>
        <p>
          Displayed totals are based on selected services. The website does not
          process payment-card details; payment is made at the shop. Contact the
          shop as early as possible if plans change. Staff may record cancellations,
          reasons, and no-shows to protect booking capacity and maintain records.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          A private, one-use rating link may be emailed after completion and expires
          after the stated period. By submitting a rating or comment, you allow TOL
          Barbershop to use it for service evaluation and, when selected, public
          display with appropriate booking context.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          Do not submit false, abusive, automated, speculative, or conflicting
          bookings; impersonate others; misuse participant or staff data; bypass
          security or rate limits; disrupt the service; or violate applicable law.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Service changes and responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          We may update, suspend, or discontinue features and schedules. Nothing in
          these terms limits rights that cannot lawfully be limited under Philippine
          consumer or privacy law. These terms are governed by Philippine law.
        </p>
